# FPGA-Based RISC-V Maze Solver (C Implementation)

## 📌 Introduction – VSD Squadron FPGA Mini
The **VSD Squadron FPGA Mini** is a compact, low-power FPGA development board designed for experimenting with digital logic design, RISC-V processor implementation, and embedded systems applications. It features:
- **FPGA Device**: Lattice iCE40 series
- **Clock Frequency**: 12 MHz
- **Interfaces**: GPIO, UART, PWM, SPI, and I²C
- **Ideal For**: FPGA beginners, RISC-V architecture learners, robotics and embedded system projects.

This board is used in this project to implement a **RISC-V based maze solver** that uses ultrasonic sensors for wall detection and navigation logic.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The key objective of this project is to develop a **microarchitecture (RISC-V controller)** so that the micromouse maze solver bot can find a path from a designated **start point** to an **end point** within a maze, **efficiently and accurately**.

This involves:
- Navigating through a **complex network** of paths and walls.
- Avoiding **dead ends**.
- Using **algorithms** and strategies to explore and solve the maze.
- Adapting to **various maze configurations**.
- Overcoming challenges such as **loops**, **multiple paths**, and **dynamic changes** within the maze environment.
