## FPGA-Based RISC-V Maze Solver (C Implementation)

### üìå Introduction ‚Äì VSD Squadron FPGA Mini
The **VSD Squadron FPGA Mini** is a compact, low-power FPGA development board designed for experimenting with digital logic design, RISC-V processor implementation, and embedded systems applications. It features:
- **FPGA Device**: Lattice iCE40 series
- **Clock Frequency**: 12 MHz
- **Interfaces**: GPIO, UART, PWM, SPI, and I¬≤C
- **Ideal For**: FPGA beginners, RISC-V architecture learners, robotics and embedded system projects.

This board is used in this project to implement a **RISC-V based maze solver** that uses ultrasonic sensors for wall detection and navigation logic.

### üéØ Project Objective
The key objective of this project is to develop a **microarchitecture (RISC-V controller)** so that the micromouse maze solver bot can find a path from a designated **start point** to an **end point** within a maze, **efficiently and accurately**.

This involves:
- Navigating through a **complex network** of paths and walls.
- Avoiding **dead ends**.
- Using **algorithms** and strategies to explore and solve the maze.
- Adapting to **various maze configurations**.
- Overcoming challenges such as **loops**, **multiple paths**, and **dynamic changes** within the maze environment.

## üìÇ Project Structure and Versions

### Version 1 ‚Äì Modular Implementation
- Files:
  - `main.c` ‚Äì Main control logic.
  - `UltrasonicSensor.c` ‚Äì Ultrasonic sensor reading and processing.
  - `UltrasonicSensor.h` ‚Äì Header file with sensor declarations.
- Features:
  - Sensor and control logic separated for better maintainability.
  - Easier to debug and extend.
- Compile and run:
Absolutely! Here's a clear explanation of the **Compile and Run** section for your README:

---

### Compile and Run


**Step 1: Compile the code**

Use the following command to compile `main.c` and `UltrasonicSensor.c` together into a single executable file named `main`:

```bash
gcc main.c UltrasonicSensor.c -o main
```

* `gcc` is the GNU Compiler Collection command for compiling C programs.
* `main.c UltrasonicSensor.c` are the source files being compiled.
* `-o main` specifies the output executable file name (`main`).

If the compilation is successful, no errors will appear, and an executable file named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows) will be created in your current directory.

---

**Step 2: Run the program**

  ```bash
 .\main.exe
  ```
